# Unsupervised and Supervised Learning, Quantum Computing, and Quantum Neural Networks

This repository contains projects that demonstrate advanced techniques in unsupervised and supervised learning, as well as quantum computing and quantum neural networks. The work presented here showcases my skills and understanding in these important areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

This was done for the AI course in 2024 at the University of Tehran under the instruction of Professor Khoshnevisan.
